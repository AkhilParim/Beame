Tree selection. Trees planted under section 33-108 must be selected from the street trees list (Appendix A-3). All plant stock shall meet the Standard for Nursery Stock Specifications, as established by the American Association of Nurserymen (1986 ed.) on file in the office of the\\n---\\ncity secretary.  \\nThe following factors should be considered in the selection of trees from the tree and shrub lists, Appendices A-1, A-2, A-3, and D:  \\nA. Hardiness of trees for the specific site, i.e., soil conditions, pH, drainage.\\nB. Mature plant size, form and growth rates, i.e., proximity to overhead utility lines.\\nC. Drought tolerance.\\nD. Pest and insect resistance.  \\nII. Tree planting:\\nA. Holes for the trees should be excavated 1½ to two feet greater in width than the diameter of the soil ball. The sides of the hole should be vertical and the bottom horizontal. Trees should be planted with the top of the root ball two inches above existing grade. No holes should be left uncovered overnight.  \\nB. Trees should be set in an upright plumb position at depth two inches higher than grown in the container. Care should be taken so as not to injure the root system, trunk, or foliage. The trunk should not be used as a level in positioning or moving the tree in the planting hole.  \\nC. The backfill should consist of topsoil excavated from the planting hole. If there is not enough topsoil, a supplement of similar topsoil should be furnished. Each planting hole should be backfilled and tamped lightly so as not to damage roots. A saucer should be constructed six to eight inches above soil grade around the planting hole and should be a minimum of six feet in diameter, free of weeds and grass.  \\nD. Any pruning should be done according to the standards of the National Arborist Association (rev. 1988) (The Meeting Place Mall, Route 101, P.O. box 1094, Amherst, NH 03031), on file in the office of the city secretary. All damaged limbs should be removed. The tree should be maintained in a shape appropriate to its species. Street trees should be pruned in accordance with the standards for hazard pruning contained in class III.  \\nE. Trees planted hereunder should be staked with a minimum of two stakes, eight feet long, attached to the tree with plastic tree chain, one inch in size, or equivalent, in a manner that is secure and will not injure the tree. Any 100-gallon trees should be tri-staked (three stakes). Other types of securing ties or devices may be used if designed for that purpose.  \\nF. Mulch shall be placed loosely around trees planted hereunder within 24 hours after planting to a uniform depth of three to four inches and to a diameter of six feet. No leaves, branches, roots or other foreign material may be used as a mulch. This area should be maintained free of weeds and grass vegetation with a three to four inch mulch cover for a minimum period of one year.\\n---\\nIII. *Watering*. The following watering schedule may be utilized and revised during prolonged periods of rain or drought.  \\n| Period | Watering Instructions |\\n|--------|------------------------|\\n| Initial Watering After Planting | Root zones should be slow-soaked every seven days for four weeks. |\\n| November<br>December<br>January<br>February | In the absence of sufficient rainfall, root zones should be slow-soaked on a twenty-one-day water schedule. |\\n| October<br>March<br>April | In the absence of sufficient rainfall, root zones should be slow-soaked on a fourteen-day water schedule. |\\n| May<br>June<br>July<br>August<br>September | In the absence of sufficient rainfall, root zones should be slow-soaked on a seven-day watering schedule. |  \\nAPPENDIX D. - SHRUB LIST  \\n| Expected Height After 3 Years (in feet) | Common Name | Botanical Name |\\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\\n|| Evergreens   |                 |\\n---\\n| Height (ft) | Common Name | Scientific Name |\\n|------------|-------------|-----------------|\\n| 1—3 | Japanese Boxwood | Buxus microphylla japonica |\\n| 1 | Dwarf Euonymus | Euonymus japonica \"Microphylla\" |\\n| 2—3 | Silver King Euonymus | Euonymus japonica \"Silver King\" |\\n| 1—2 | Dwarf Gardenia | Gardenia jasminoides \"Radicans\" |\\n| 2—3 | Dwarf Burford Holly | Ilex cornuta \"Burfordii Nana\" |\\n| 2—3 | Dwarf Chinese Holly | Ilex cornuta \"Rotunda\" |\\n| 1—2 | Compact Japanese Holly | Ilex crenata \"Compacta\" |\\n| 1—3 | Dwarf Yaupon Holly | Ilex vomitoria \"Nana\" |\\n| 1—2 | Primrose Jasmine | Jasminum mesnyi |\\n| 3—4 | Texas Sage | Leucophyllum Frutescens |\\n| 3—4 | Dwarf Wax Myrtle | Myrica cerifera |\\n| 1 | Dwarf Purply Nandina | Nandina domestica nana \"Purpurea\" |\\n| 2—3 | Harbor Dwarf Nandina | Nandina domestica nana \"Harbor Dwarf\" |\\n| 2—3 | Dwarf Oleander | Nerium oleander |\\n| 1—2 | Turner\\'s Dwarf Pittosporum | Pittosporum tobira \"Turner\\'s Dwarf\" |\\n| 1—2 | Wheeler\\'s Dwarf Pittosporum | Pittosporum tobia \"Wheeler\\'s Dwarf\" |\\n| 3—4 | Fraser\\'s Photinia | Photinia x fraseri |\\n| 2—3 | Red Elf Pyracantha | Pyracantha \"Red Elf\" |\\n---\\n| 2—4 | Indian Hawthorne | Raphiolepis indica |\\n|-----|-------------------|---------------------|\\n| 2—3 | Red Spirea | Spiraea x bumalda \"Anthony Waterer\" |\\n| 3—4 | Spring Bouquet Vib | Viburnum tinus \"Spring Bouquet\" |\\n| 6 | Red Tip Photina | Photinia glabra |\\n| 6 | Chinese Photina | Photinia serrulata |\\n| 6 | Waxleaf Ligustrum | Ligustrum japonicum |\\n| 6 | Southern Wax Myrtle | Myrica cerifera |'),\n",

No requirement added to those stated hereunder for the franchise, whether now or subsequently authorized by law, shall be defeated by the company on the ground that the ordinance granting the franchise and the acceptance thereof constitutes a contract, the obligation whereof is impaired by such additional requirement.  \\n(m) Should the city council find that public convenience and necessity require the removal of the tracks installed pursuant to the franchise, city council reserves and shall have the absolute right to terminate the franchise.

The monthly fee for the provision, management and use of the containers for basic garbage collection service is stated in the city fee schedule. The fee shall be paid annually in advance by the residential unit customer in accordance with billing procedures established by the director; provided that upon presentation of a city water account number, the city may bill the basic garbage collection service fee to the residential unit customer's city water account on a monthly basis.  \\n*Sunset provision.* The fee established in this item (1) of this subsection for the lease and management of garbage and recycling containers for residential units will expire on July 1, 2024, unless otherwise amended or extended by city council.  \\n(1a) *Extra capacity.* Upon request, and subject to the requirements of 39-63(2)(b), a residential unit customer shall be provided up to two additional automated service containers upon advance payment by money order or cashier's check of the monthly extra capacity service fee per automated service container stated for this provision in the city fee schedule. A city water customer who desires to contract for billing of the extra capacity service fee through the customer's city water account may provide the director the customer's city water account number and advance payment of the first monthly extra capacity service fee for each additional automated service container requested. Thereafter, a monthly charge for each additional container will be billed through the customer's water account. Each additional automated service container shall bear an extra capacity sticker containing serial or other identification numbers and shall be issued by the department for a minimum service period of 12 months.  \\n(2) *Replacement for damage or loss of container.* The department will replace a container at no charge to a residential unit customer, if:\\na. It is damaged beyond use by city collectors; or\\nb. It is lost as a result of a disaster for which the mayor has declared a local state of emergency or local state of disaster; or\\nc. It is lost as a result of a severe weather event that results in localized flooding for which the mayor has determined that fees for container replacement will not be charged.  \\n(3) *Replacement due to routine wear.* The department will replace a container due to routine wear when necessary at no charge to a residential unit customer, but not more frequently than once every ten years, and will provide a second replacement within the same time period at a reduced cost only if:\\na. The residential unit customer requesting a second container is a senior citizen over the age of 65; or\\nb. The residential unit customer is enrolled in the department's pickup for persons with disabilities program as identified in Section 39-80.\\n---\\nFor these categories of residential unit customers, the replacement fee shall be waived for a second replacement and only the delivery fee shall be charged.  \\n(4) Replacement for other reason. For a container that requires replacement for reasons other than those stated in items (2) and (3) of this subsection, the department shall replace a residential unit customer's container upon payment therefor by the residential unit customer using any payment method described in item (1a) of this subsection. The cost for container replacement includes the container delivery fee in addition to the city's actual cost to purchase the replacement container, each as set forth in the city fee schedule.  \\n(5) City container not in compliance. Only a city container that is directly provided by the department to the residential unit customer under the department's residential service program, extra capacity service program, or non-residential service program will be serviced by the city. Any other city container presented by a residential unit customer for service will be retrieved by the city at the residential unit customer's expense.

When used in this section, the term subdivision identification marker means a marker placed in the public right-of-way intended to identify a residential community or residential development with 50 or more platted single-family residential lots. The city engineer may issue a variance for subdivision identification markers for a residential community or residential development with less than 50 single-family residential lots.  \\n(b) Encroachment permit required. A subdivision identification marker installed after December 31, 2008, in the median of a public street right-of-way or in unimproved excess public street right-of-way of a street within, abutting or adjacent to the subdivision must have an encroachment permit issued by the city engineer's office and shall not be subject to the requirements of the Sign Code.  \\n(c) Design standards. A subdivision identification marker must contain the name of the recorded subdivision, and may contain an insignia or motto of the subdivision in addition to identification directly related to the residential community or development, such as 'deed restrictions enforced' and civic association/homeowner's association meeting announcements. A subdivision identification marker may not include any advertising content unrelated to the subdivision, and may not contain any moving, electronic, LED or other changeable message.  \\nThe design of the subdivision identification marker shall conform to the standards set forth in the Infrastructure Design Manual, as promulgated and revised from time to time by Houston Public Works. The city engineer must approve each request for more than two subdivision identification markers in the public street right-of-way and may restrict the number of subdivision identification markers for a subdivision taking into account the number of lots in the subdivision, the number of major entrances to the subdivision, and the area (acreage) of the subdivision. The city engineer may establish minimum clearances for subdivision identification markers from the edge of the pavement. The city engineer may also specify acceptable foundations for subdivision identification markers in the public street right-of-way and may require frangible or breakaway marker supports. Variances to any design standards for proposed subdivision identification markers must be granted by the city engineer.  \\n(d) Application for encroachment permit. A subdivision developer or homeowners' association may apply to the city engineer for an encroachment permit for subdivision identification markers. The application for subdivision identification markers must identify the person, partnership,\\n---\\nassociation, corporation or other legal entity responsible for the perpetual maintenance of the marker and\\ninclude a drawing, approved by Houston Public Works, that shows the design, location, size, height, and\\nmaterial composition of all markers to be permitted, and the location of any utility (water, sanitary sewer,\\nstorm sewer, electricity, telephone, cable) facilities in the immediate vicinity of the markers. Each\\nsubdivision identification marker must be located so as not to constitute a traffic hazard and shall not be\\nlocated within the visibility triangle, as defined in section 33-101 of this Code, or otherwise impair the\\nvisibility of a vehicle from a road or driveway. The application fees for subdivision identification markers to\\nbe located in the public street right-of-way shall be stated for this provision in the city fee schedule. All\\napplication fees shall be payable at the time of application for an encroachment permit.  \\n(e) Issuance of encroachment permit. An encroachment permit for subdivision identification markers\\ninstalled or to be installed in the public street right-of-way shall be issued by the city engineer on\\nterms approved by the city engineer. A legal representative for the applicant shall be required to\\nsign the offered encroachment permit to indicate acceptance of the terms and undertakings\\ntherein, whereupon the applicant shall then be the holder of the encroachment permit.  \\n(f) Transfer of encroachment permit. An encroachment permit issued to a developer may be\\ntransferred to a homeowners' association upon approval of the city engineer following the\\nsubmittal of an instrument setting forth the undertaking of the homeowners' association to\\ncomply with all the terms of the encroachment permit and to assume all the obligations and\\nresponsibilities of the prior holder of the encroachment permit.  \\n(g) Existing subdivision identification markers. Subdivision identification markers located within the\\npublic right-of-way on December 31, 2008, must be registered with the Houston Public Works.\\nHouston Public Works shall publish a form to register existing subdivision identification markers.\\nNo fees will be assessed for registration of existing subdivision identification markers.  \\n(h) Maintenance, repair and replacement. As used in this subsection, the term holder refers to the\\nholder of an encroachment permit for a subdivision identification marker and the registrant for\\nan existing subdivision identification marker. The holder shall be, and the city shall not be,\\nresponsible for any and all maintenance, repair, and/or replacement for the subdivision\\nidentification marker, marker support, structure, illumination, and associated landscaping. The\\ncity may require the holder, upon 30-days written notice, to perform maintenance, repair,\\nrelocation, or removal of the subdivision identification marker, marker structure, and any\\nassociated landscaping. After expiration of the 30-day notice, the city may cause the\\nmaintenance, repair or removal of the subdivision identification marker at the expense of the\\nholder. In the event that the city needs to perform improvements, maintenance, or repairs of\\ninfrastructure within the right-of-way, the city may, without providing 30-days written notice,\\ncause the removal or alteration of the subdivision identification marker or marker structure and\\n---\\nlandscaping without repair, replacement, or compensation to the holder.

Prior to such suspension the traffic engineer shall give ten days\\' written notice to the licensee of his violation of or his failure to observe a general condition as set out above. If the licensee requests a hearing prior to the expiration of that ten-day notice period, the traffic engineer shall hold a hearing to determine if the license shall be suspended. The licensee may present evidence in his own behalf if he so desires. The traffic engineer\\'s decision in regard to suspension shall be final. If the licensee fails to request such a hearing, the suspension shall become effective upon the expiration of the ten-day notice period. If operations under a license granted under this section are suspended, all tables, chairs and other appurtenances used as a part of the sidewalk café shall be immediately removed from the sidewalk.  \\n(7) All notices required or permitted under this section shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered three days after deposit in a United States Postal Service post office or receptacle with proper postage affixed and addressed to the licensee at the street address provided by the licensee (the applicant\\'s name and street address) in his application for a sidewalk café license.  \\n(e) Operations:\\n(1) No licensee shall cause, permit or allow the following conditions to exist:  \\na. Preset tables.\\nb. Litter or trash on the sidewalk or street right-of-way.\\nc. Any temporary obstruction in the public clearance way (i.e., ice carts, waiters, chairs, etc.).\\n---\\nd.

In the event that three such notices are issued for violations of the above provisions, within a one-year period, the traffic engineer shall, after notice to the licensee, hold a hearing to determine if the license shall be revoked. The licensee may submit evidence in his own behalf if he so desires. The traffic engineer\\'s decision with regard to revocation shall be deemed final. If a license granted hereunder shall be revoked, all tables, chairs and other appurtenances used as a part of the sidewalk café shall be immediately removed from the sidewalk.  \\n(3) In the event that the city health department issues a notice of violation of any of the ordinances of the city to a licensee in connection with the operation or any condition attributable to the licensee\\'s sidewalk café, that department shall immediately notify the traffic engineer of the issuance of that notice. Conversely, if the traffic engineer is notified of or becomes aware of any condition or occurrence which may constitute a violation of any food or health-related ordinance, the traffic engineer shall immediately so notify the Houston Health Department.  \\n(4) In addition to the provisions of subsection (e)(1) hereof, a license shall be revocable without liability therefor if the traffic engineer finds that a public necessity or emergency exists requiring an immediate revocation of the license and termination of operation of the sidewalk café or in the event of lawful need for the site or for access thereto by the city or any utility company, in which case the city may remove the facilities on the site or order the licensee to do so. The traffic engineer shall provide written notice to the licensee as promptly as possible. This notice shall state the reason or reasons removal is or was required. Public necessity for these purposes shall include changed circumstances causing increased pedestrian or vehicular traffic in the area. Notice under this clause shall constitute an exception to the notice provisions of subsection (d)(7).  \\n(f) Fees and bond:  \\n(1) The fee for a sidewalk café license or a renewal of a sidewalk café license is stated for this provision in the city fee schedule.  \\n(2) The licensee shall also provide a cash bond or a bond with the licensee as principal and a corporate bonding company licensed to do business in the state as surety in an amount determined by the traffic engineer to be sufficient to cover the costs of removal of the licensee\\'s facilities by the city or any public utility under any of the provisions of this section, conditioned that the licensee will timely remove its facilities upon request therefor and will reimburse the city or a public utility in the event that the city or a public utility removes the facilities pursuant to this section. Any licensee who received his sidewalk café license\\n---\\nhereunder on or before the June 1, 1985, shall have 60 days to provide a bond as required hereunder. If such a licensee fails to deliver such a bond to the traffic engineer, his sidewalk café license shall terminate upon the expiration of that 60-day period.  \\n(Ord.

No deductible shall exceed ten percent of\\nthe minimum limits of liability or one percent of the consolidated net worth of permittee and its\\npermitted affiliates, whichever is greater.  \\nPermittee shall assume and bear any claims or losses to the extent of deductible amounts and waives\\nany claim it may ever have for the same against the city and its officers, agents or employees in respect\\nof any covered event.  \\nAll such policies and certificates shall contain an agreement that the insurer shall notify the director of\\nadministration and regulatory affairs in writing not less than 30 days before any material change,\\nreduction in coverage or cancellation of any policy. Permittee shall give written notice to the director of\\nadministration and regulatory affairs within five days of the date upon which total claims by any party\\nagainst permittee reduce the aggregate amount of coverage below the amounts required by the permit.  \\nEach policy must contain an endorsement to the effect that the issuer waives any claim or right in the\\nnature of subrogation to recover against the city, its officers, agents or employees.  \\nEach policy must contain an endorsement that such policy is primary insurance to any other insurance\\navailable to the city as an additional insured with respect to claims arising thereunder.\\n---\\nPermittee shall be entitled to purchase and maintain the insurance required under this subsection under so-called \"blanket policies,\" provided the coverage thereunder is at least at the levels contained herein and is otherwise adequate in keeping with prudent underwriting standards.  \\nAt the time of application, and at the director of administration and regulatory affairs\\' request, permittee shall provide certificates of insurance reflecting that the terms of this subsection have been met. Notwithstanding the proof of insurance requirements set forth in this subsection, permittee, throughout the term of its permit, continuously and without interruption, shall maintain in force the required insurance coverages set forth in this subsection.  \\nIn lieu of maintaining policies of insurance described in this subsection, permittee may elect to self-insure against the risks described in this subsection, provided that permittee submits to the director documents showing either (i) self-insurance reserves or other assets sufficient to pay judgments equal to the minimum limits of liability set forth in this subsection, or (ii) a net worth that exceeds ten times the aggregate minimum limits of liability set forth in this subsection. If, during the term of a permit ordinance, any such self-insurance program ceases or the self-insured\\'s assets, reserves or net worth are no longer adequate to provide the above coverages, permittee shall immediately notify the city of such lapse of coverage and obtain or cause to be obtained commercial insurance in accordance with the requirements of this subsection within 30 days. If permittee self-insures, permittee has a duty to defend the city in the same manner as a permittee with insurance in any suit seeking damages against the city in connection with permittee\\'s pipeline, and permittee will pay all costs and expenses of such defense or reimburse the city for all costs and expenses incurred by the city for such defense.\"  \\n(q) Events of termination. A permit ordinance issued under this article shall, at the option of the city council, terminate (as to the affected pipeline or portion thereof only in the event of an occurrence under items (1), (5) or (6) of this subsection) upon the occurrence of any one or more of the events described below (collectively referred to herein as \\'events of termination\\'). Each event of termination is a separate and independent basis for termination of the permit (or application thereof to the affected pipeline or portion thereof, as applicable). The events of termination are as follows:  \\n(1) The city council, in its legislative discretion, determines that the existence or operation of a pipeline, or any part thereof, constitutes a hazard, nuisance or other threat to the public health, safety or welfare or that the existence or continued operation of the pipeline, or any part thereof, interferes with the current or prospective use of a street. Termination under this subsection shall be by ordinance and become effective after permittee has been given 180 days\\' notice of such termination, unless circumstances comprising a bona fide emergency and an imperative public necessity warrant more immediate termination.  \\n(2) Expiration of the term of the permit ordinance.  \\n(3)\\n---\\nPermittee fails to timely pay any of the fees herein provided for or is delinquent in the payment of any charges due under the permit ordinance.  \\n(4) Permittee fails to maintain at any time the insurance as required in this article.  \\n(5) Permittee fails to commence or thereafter to diligently prosecute to completion any required maintenance, repair or other work required by this article to be done by permittee within 30 days after being notified of such required action by the director. In the event of an emergency, notice shall be deemed given and received after telephone contact with an authorized officer or director of permittee, and permittee shall commence the requested repairs within 24 hours.  \\n(6) Permittee abandons the pipeline.  \\n(7) Permittee fails to file a written acceptance of the permit ordinance within the time and in the manner prescribed in this article.  \\n(8) Permittee fails to comply with any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the permit ordinance or this article.  \\n(9) Permittee commences dissolution or some other similar proceeding that would impair, modify, alter, extinguish or significantly change permittee\\'s ability to perform permittee\\'s obligations under the permit ordinance.  \\nUpon the occurrence of an event of termination described in item (1) or (2) of this subsection, such an event of termination may not be cured by permittee and the permit ordinance shall terminate (only as to the affected pipeline in the event of termination pursuant to item (1), (5), or (6) of this subsection) in the manner and in accordance with the applicable provisions of said subsections and the permit ordinance. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events of termination other than in item (1) or (2) of this subsection, the director or director of administration and regulatory affairs shall so notify permittee in the manner provided in the permit ordinance. After such notice, permittee shall have 30 days in which to cure the event of termination. Should permittee fail or refuse to cure the event of termination within the 30-day time period prescribed, city council may terminate the permit ordinance (only as to the affected pipeline or portion thereof in the event of termination pursuant to item (5) or (6) of this subsection; provided that if permittee commences efforts to cure such event of termination within 30 days after receipt of such written notice and thereafter prosecutes such efforts with reasonable diligence in the sole determination of city council until such event of termination is cured, then such event of termination shall cease to exist and no action to terminate the permit ordinance or an application thereof will be taken. Failure of the city to enforce its rights and remedies under this section with respect to one event of termination shall not operate as a waiver of the city\\'s right to thereafter enforce its rights and remedies with respect to any such continuing event of termination or another event of termination. Termination of\\n---\\nthe permit ordinance or an application thereof shall not waive, release or satisfy any duty, covenant or obligation of permittee under this article or the permit ordinance which permittee has not fully performed as of the time of termination.  \\n(r) Transfer of authority.  \\n(1) Notice. A person may acquire and own pipeline prior to being permitted pursuant to this article if (i) the permittee notifies the city within ten days of the transfer of ownership, and (ii) permittee retains all responsibilities associated with the permit until the city approves the transfer of the permit.  \\n(2) Prohibition. Neither the permit ordinance nor the permit granted thereby may be assigned, in whole or in part, without the prior consent of the city council expressed by resolution or ordinance, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. No assignment in law or otherwise shall be effective until the assignee has filed with the director an instrument, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms of this article, and agreeing to comply with all of the provisions of the permit ordinance. A mortgage or other pledge of assets in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment for the purposes of this section.  \\n(3) Process. Upon receipt of a request for consent to an assignment, the director shall diligently investigate the request in a timely manner and recommend placement of the request on the city council agenda at the earliest practicable time. The city council shall proceed to act on the request within a reasonable period of time.  \\n(4) Scope of review. In reviewing a request for consent to an assignment, the city may inquire into the technical and financial qualifications of the prospective assignee, and permittee shall assist the city in so inquiring.  \\n(5) Assignments not requiring approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, the approval of the city shall not be required for any assignment (1) to any permitted affiliate; (2) to any entity with which permittee or an affiliate of permittee shares joint ownership of the pipeline, as long as permittee is retained as the manager of day-to-day pipeline operations; or (3) to any entity that is a holder of a then current permit ordinance enacted by the city on or after the effective date. Permittee shall give written notice of such assignment to the director.  \\n(6) Release. Upon receiving the director\\'s consent to an assignment or, in the event of an assignment qualifying under subsection (r)(5), upon giving notice under subsection (r)(5), the assigning permittee shall be relieved of all conditions, obligations, and liabilities arising or which might arise under the assigned permit, from and after the date of assignment.  \\n(s)\\n---\\nCathodic protection. Any cathodic protection system used with permittee\\'s pipelines shall not cause any existing public facilities in the vicinity of the pipeline and known to permittee to be sacrificed or experience materially accelerated corrosion as a result of the operation of such cathodic protection system.  \\n(Ord.

Upon receipt of any such request, the telecommunications provider shall promptly designate or identify the specific information proposed to be withheld and the law supporting or authorizing its non-disclosure.  \\n(c) Payment due date. Each telecommunications provider shall remit fees on an annual basis. Payment shall be made on or before the payment date. Fees that are not received by the city by the payment date shall incur interest beginning on the date the payment is due at the rate of twelve percent per annum, compounded daily.  \\n(d) Circumvention of fee prohibited. A telecommunications provider shall not underpay fees due to the city, circumvent payment of the fee for use of the public way or evade payment of fees by barter, transfer of rights, or any other means that results in undercounting of the telecommunications providers' linear feet of network facilities in the public way within the city.\\n---\\n(e) Leased network facilities.  \\n(1) A telecommunications provider may lease its network facilities or otherwise make its network facilities available, in whole or in part, to its customers in the ordinary provision of services, if the telecommunications provider retains the responsibility for servicing and repairing the network facilities. This shall not be construed to provide any person, other than an affiliate, with authority to place any facilities in the public way without a valid franchise granted by the city, if one is required. The director shall determine whether a franchise is required in accordance with applicable law, and such determination shall be made as if the third party were the owner of the network facilities used by the third party, rather than the telecommunications provider. A telecommunications provider shall notify the city within 30 days of any lease of its network facilities.  \\n(2) A telecommunications provider's acceptance of a network facilities franchise constitutes its agreement to notify its customers or subscribers making sales of telecommunications services through the use of its network facilities of the possible need for a certificate from the Public Utility Commission of Texas, an FCC license, other state or federal authorization, or city franchise. A telecommunications provider shall notify its existing customers or subscribers of the requirement of this provision within 30 days of the acquisition of each customer or subscriber.  \\n(f) Fees paid pursuant to this section shall constitute the sole compensation to the city for a telecommunications provider's use of the public way.  \\n(Ord. No. 98-593, § 1, 7-22-98; Ord. No. 2010-831, § 2(Exh. A), 10-27-2010)  \\nSec. 40-336. - Conditions of network facilities franchise.  \\nA network facilities franchise that is granted to any telecommunications provider under this article shall incorporate the terms of this article and be further subject to the following specific provisions, whether or not such terms are specifically included in such network facilities franchise:  \\n(1) Enforcement. The city attorney, or the city attorney's designee, shall have the right to enforce all legal rights and obligations under the network facilities franchise without further authorization. The telecommunications provider shall provide the city access to all documents and records the city attorney deems reasonably necessary to assist in determining the telecommunications provider's compliance with the network facilities franchise.  \\n(2) Interference with public use prohibited. The obligation and duty of a telecommunications provider to lay, construct, operate, lease, maintain, repair and replace the network facilities shall not interfere with the public use of the public way. Insofar as it is practical to do so, the telecommunications provider shall use existing network facilities in the provision of the services. The telecommunications provider shall provide and maintain current any\\n---\\ninformation reasonably related to location or operation of the network facilities or services determined to be necessary by the city engineer or the director. The telecommunications provider shall maintain the network facilities in good order and condition, subject to ordinary wear and tear.  \\n(3) *Permit fees included in fee.* A portion of the fee due to the city under a network facilities franchise constitutes payment to the city for the cost of permits and inspections, or other similar approvals or submissions that a telecommunications provider is required to obtain for its work in the public way under a network facilities franchise. As a result, no additional fees shall be charged to the telecommunications provider. This subsection shall not be construed to waive any requirement relating to permitting, inspections or similar approvals or submissions other than the payment of separate fees.  \\n(4) *Permitting and plan approval.*  \\na. *New construction permit.* Before commencing any work in the public way other than routine maintenance or emergency work (as described in subsections b. and c. below), a telecommunications provider shall apply for and obtain a new construction permit. The application shall include a written work description, including scale drawings with plan and profile, showing the network facilities' location (or proposed location) and estimated depth of the network facilities (existing and proposed) in the immediate area of the proposed new construction. Such drawings and specifications shall be prepared, executed and sealed by a registered professional engineer, as may be required by the Texas Engineering Practice Act or by the city engineer. Such drawings and specifications will be reviewed by the city engineer and any comments will be provided to the telecommunications provider as soon as practicable. The telecommunications provider shall make any changes to the drawings and specifications requested by the city engineer.  \\nb. *Routine maintenance.* The Director of Houston Public Works may promulgate rules and procedures for routine maintenance of existing network facilities located in the public way, including but not limited to required notices by the telecommunications provider that the telecommunications provider shall provide, standards for street and curb repairs, and inspection of facilities and street repairs necessitated by such maintenance. Routine maintenance or repair performed on existing network facilities located in the public way shall be performed in a manner consistent with city standards promulgated by the Director of Houston Public Works.  \\nc. *Emergency repairs.* Emergency repairs requiring immediate work may be performed by the telecommunications provider and notice shall be given in writing to the Director of Houston Public Works within 24 hours following the commencement of such repairs. The notice shall state the nature of the emergency, the repairs required and an estimate of the time necessary to complete the repairs. The telecommunications provider shall apply\\n---\\nfor all required approvals, including those required under article XVII of this chapter as soon as reasonably practicable. Any work performed that is not consistent with city standards shall be corrected upon notice from the Director of Houston Public Works.  \\nd. Payment of fees required. The city is not required to grant any permit or approval to the telecommunications provider unless and until all fees due and payable pursuant to the network facilities franchise have been paid in full.  \\ne. Other licenses and fees. The telecommunications provider shall obtain and pay the cost of all licenses, permits, and certificates required by any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation of any state or federal regulatory body having jurisdiction over the conduct of its operations hereunder. The telecommunications provider shall give notice to the director of any revocation or failure to obtain any such license, permit or certificate affecting its performance hereunder within 15 days of such revocation or of the day upon which the telecommunications provider received actual or constructive notice of its failure to obtain such license, permit or certificate.  \\nf. City engineer's procedures. Notwithstanding the above, the city engineer may promulgate procedures, applicable to all similarly situated telecommunications providers, regarding pre-approval of work in the public way by a telecommunications provider in circumstances that do not require detailed review of the proposed work.  \\n(5) Work standards. All work in the public way shall be performed in accordance with the city's Standard Construction Specifications and Standard Construction Details, as such may be amended from time to time, and shall be subject to the regulation, control and direction of the Director of Houston Public Works. All work done in connection with the laying, construction, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the network facilities shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of city, the applicable county, the state, and the United States.  \\n(6) Work in the public way. Any work that constitutes an obstruction of a street for which a permit is required under section 40-362 of this Code shall only be performed in accordance with a permit issued under article XVII of this chapter.  \\n(7) Restoration. A telecommunications provider shall repair, clean up and restore the public way disturbed or affected during the maintenance, construction, repair, replacement or removal of the network facilities in accordance with article V of this chapter.  \\n(8) Relocation or removal. A telecommunications provider may be required to relocate its network facilities in any public way in accordance with article XVIII of this chapter.  \\n(9) Subsequent rules and regulations. The city council or the Director of Houston Public Works may make such other reasonable rules and regulations for the placement and manner of the network facilities as they may deem appropriate for the protection of the public and the\\n---\\npublic way and to avoid unreasonable interference with other uses or contemplated uses of the public way. Without limitation of the above, the city council may amend the rules or regulations to require that all network facilities constructed after the effective date of such amended rules be placed underground.  \\n(10) **Inspections.** The city engineer may perform inspections, upon 24 hour written notice from the city, of any network facilities located in the public way from time to time as deemed appropriate. A telecommunications provider may have a representative present during such inspection.  \\n(11) **Abandonment of obsolete network facilities.** Upon request by the city engineer, a telecommunications provider shall remove aerial facilities and/or facilities in conduits when such facilities are obsolete and no longer in service. When a telecommunications provider removes or abandons permanent structures in the public way, the telecommunications provider shall notify the city engineer in writing of such removal or abandonment and shall file with the city engineer the location and description of each facility removed or abandoned. The city engineer may additionally direct remedial measures as the city engineer may determine necessary for the public safety and the integrity of the public way.  \\n(12) **Bonding.** The telecommunications provider shall comply with all applicable requirements relating to the provision of bonds or other security to the city in connection with its work in the public way.  \\n(13) **Tree trimming.** A telecommunications provider, its contractors and agents may trim trees that are upon and overhanging the public way and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the telecommunications provider's fiber or cables. At the option of the city, said trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city or of any city official to whom said duties have been or may be delegated.  \\n(14) **Indemnification and insurance.** The network facilities franchise shall contain indemnity and insurance provisions in a form acceptable to the city attorney.  \\n(15) **Default and termination; valuation.** A network facilities franchise shall contain provisions relating to default and termination. For purposes of compliance with article II, section 17 of the charter of the city, unless the network facilities franchise provides otherwise, there shall be no requirement that the network facilities be purchased by the city upon termination of a network facilities franchise.  \\n(16) **Other terms and conditions.** The network facilities franchise may contain such other terms and conditions as the director and the city attorney may prescribe and city council may approve that are not inconsistent with the terms of this article.  \\n(Ord.

For example, if the total dedication requirement is 5 acres and the applicant proposes to include 2.1 acres of private park within the subdivision, 2.1 acres will be deducted from the total requirement. Private park land eligible for credit must be centrally located within the development, designed so that it cannot easily be joined into one or more adjacent lots with a fence, legally and practically accessible to all residents of the development, and of a size, shape and configuration so that it is likely to be used by residents of the development as determined in comparison to city park standards.

If credit is given on a subdivision plat for low and moderate income single family housing, the property owner shall certify prior to the issuance of a building permit for the house that the initial purchase price does not exceed the latest available 12-month listing for median price single family housing in the city as published by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. In the event the initial purchase price exceeds this amount, the property owner making the certification shall pay to the city the then-current fee in lieu of dedication for a single family dwelling unit. If publication of the median price for single family housing is discontinued by the Real Estate Center at the Texas A&M University, the mayor is authorized to select another publication that lists the median price of single family houses in the city.  \\nc. Up to a maximum of 100 percent of the total requirement credit shall be given for each acre or portion thereof of park land provided as a greenbelt along a creek bed or around the perimeter of the subdivision or development generating the dedication requirement, including improvements to a hike or bike trail that meet city standards.  \\nd.

The city council may, by ordinance, grant tax relief in the form of an exemption from ad valorem taxation to any \"historic site,\" which for purposes of this section means a structure that has been designated as a landmark, protected landmark, or as a contributing structure in a historic district pursuant to article VII of chapter 33 of this Code (\"Historic Preservation Ordinance\").  \\n(b) Eligibility. A property is eligible for tax exemption under this section in accordance with the following:  \\n(1) The tax exemption is only being sought for eligible work under subsection (e) of this section;  \\n(2) The eligible work performed must be at a cost of at least 25 percent of the \"base value,\" which for purposes of this section means the assessed value of the historic structure or improvements, not including the value of any land associated with the historic site;  \\n(3) The eligible work is performed not earlier than five years before the application for tax exemption; and  \\n(4) The eligible work is performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness granted by the Houston Archaeological and Historical Commission (\"HAHC\").  \\n(c) Application. An application for tax exemption under this section shall be filed with the director of the Finance Department, or his designee (\"director of finance\") in the form prescribed by the director of finance, and shall contain documentary evidence, including photographs and other documentation, of:  \\n(1) All completed work for which a tax exemption is sought;  \\n(2) Itemized accounting of eligible costs, shown as distinct from any ineligible costs, associated with any interior and exterior construction for which a tax exemption is sought; and  \\n(3) Compliance with the requirements of any certificates of appropriateness issued pursuant to the Historic Preservation Ordinance.  \\nAny application that does not contain sufficient documentary evidence under this section, including insufficiently itemized accounting of eligible costs as show distinctly from ineligible costs, shall be rejected by the director of finance and considered incomplete.\\n---\\n(d) Procedure. The director of finance shall establish and promulgate procedures for the implementation of the exemption granted under this section, the review of applications for tax exemption pursuant to this section, including deadlines for submission and consideration of applications required for a tax exemption to be effective for the next tax year. The director of finance shall calculate the projected tax exemption in accordance with this section, and forward the recommendation and projected tax exemption to city council. The city council shall approve an application for tax exemption upon receipt of a recommendation and a projected tax exemption from the director of finance.  \\n(e) Eligible work. The following work qualifies for tax exemption under this section:  \\n(1) Restoration performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness granted under the Historic Preservation Ordinance;  \\n(2) Repair or reconstruction of the historic portion of the structural components, which includes parts of a building such as walls, partitions, floors, ceilings; windows and doors; all components of a central air conditioning or heating system, whether within or adjacent to a building, including motors, compressors, pipes and ducts; plumbing and plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and bathtubs; electric wiring and lighting fixtures; chimneys; stairs, escalators, and elevators; interior sprinkler systems; fire escapes; and other components relating to the operation or maintenance of a building;  \\n(3) Interior remodeling of the historic portion of the structure\\'s paint, flooring, permanent coverings such as paneling or tiling;  \\n(4) Professional services such as architectural, engineering, and other development fees; and  \\n(5) Construction management and labor, materials, and reasonable overhead.  \\n(f) Ineligible work. The following work does not qualify for tax exemption under this section:  \\n(1) Appliances, consumer and industrial machinery, including machinery needed for the preparation and storage of food;  \\n(2) Furniture, including cabinetry and countertops;  \\n(3) Decks, fencing, retaining walls, swimming pools, and any exterior work such as sidewalks, driveways, and landscaping;  \\n(4) Acquisition costs;  \\n(5) Demolition and relocation costs;  \\n(6) All costs, both exterior and interior, associated with the construction of a new addition or new construction, as those terms are defined in the Historic Preservation Ordinance;  \\n(7) Work done outside the scope of a certificate of appropriateness required by the Historic Preservation Ordinance; and  \\n(8) Work done pursuant to a certificate of remediation issued by the HAHC.\\n---\\n(g) Annual review of tax exemption. The director of finance shall conduct an annual review of each property granted an exemption under this section and may recommend revocation of the tax exemption granted under this section to city council if:  \\n(1) The historic site is or has been the subject of a certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to sections 33-247 or 33-250 of this Code;  \\n(2) The owner of a historic site exceeds the scope of a certificate of appropriateness or takes any action without a certificate of appropriateness required by article VII of chapter 33 of this Code;  \\n(3) The owner causes the property to be demolished by neglect under section 33-254 of this Code or as a dangerous building under chapter 10 of this Code; or  \\n(4) City taxes assessed against the property are delinquent, as confirmed by the director of finance.  \\n(h) Calculation of tax exemption. An exemption granted hereunder by the city council shall exempt the historic structure or improvements not including the value of any land associated with this historic site from ad valorem taxation and shall be computed on the following basis:  \\n(1) If the said qualifying expenditures are at least 25 percent but less than 100 percent of the base value, then the exemption for each tax year on the assessed value of the structure shall be equal to the amount of the qualifying expenditures; or  \\n(2) If the said qualifying expenditures are 100 percent or more of the base value of the improvements, then for each tax year:  \\na. For single-family residential properties that are not within a qualifying census tract, the exemption shall be equal to the qualifying expenditures; or  \\nb. For properties other than single-family residential properties and all properties within a qualifying census tract, as that term is defined below, the exemption shall be equal to 100 percent of the assessed value of the historic structure or improvements not including the value of any land associated with this historic site.  \\nIn any event, however, the exemption granted to any historic site pursuant to this section shall be subject to a limitation in the form of a maximum dollar amount. The maximum dollar amount shall be the assessed value of the historic structure in the year following demonstration of completion of the restoration or preservation work and demonstration of the qualifying expenditures to the director of finance. The amount of the exemption allowed on a historic structure shall not exceed the aforesaid maximum dollar amount in any tax year for the duration of the exemption period.  \\nFor purposes of this subsection qualifying census tract means any population census tract if either:  \\n(1) The poverty rate for such tract is at least 20 percent; or  \\n(2)\\n---\\nThe median family income for such tract does not exceed 80 percent of the metropolitan area median family income.  \\n(i) Term. An exemption granted under this section shall begin on January 1 of the year following the date that the director of finance makes the determination that the owner of the historic site has met all of the requirements of this section for an exemption. The duration of the exemption shall be for a period of 15 years if the restoration project receives no financial incentive from the city funded by municipal hotel occupancy taxes, or ten years if the restoration project receives a financial incentive from the city funded by municipal hotel occupancy taxes. The exemption shall be automatically continued as of January 1 of each year succeeding the year the exemption was first granted for the duration of the ten- or 15-year period. The exemption shall be continued in the event of a transfer of an ownership interest or a portion of an ownership interest in the historic structure during such ten or 15-year period.  \\n(j) Recordation. A person who has an ownership interest in property that has been granted a historic site exemption from ad valorem taxation shall record a copy of the ordinance providing for such exemption in the form prescribed by the city attorney in the real property records of the county in which the property is located. Failure on the part of the applicant to deliver a copy of such recorded ordinance, showing the date of recordation in the appropriate real property records, to the director of finance within 90 days of the date of passage of the ordinance providing for a tax exemption shall cause the expiration of the exemption at the end of such 90-day period.  \\n(k) Recapture. Tax receipts and tax certificates issued for any historic site receiving tax relief pursuant to this section shall be clearly marked: \"Historic site—Subject to recapture of additional taxes under Code of Ordinances.\" Each year during which the property is granted tax relief, the director of finance shall note on his records the valuation which would have been made and the taxes that would have been due had the historic site not qualified for tax relief under this section. If the historic site is subsequently damaged, demolished, or destroyed, or if the tax exemption is revoked under this section, then the property shall be subject to a recapture of taxes and subject to penalties and interest calculated under pertinent provisions of the Texas Tax Code. The additional tax shall be equal to the total amount of tax relief granted under this section over the life of the structure. Such additional taxes shall be deposited in the Historic Preservation Fund. Until paid, there shall be a lien for additional taxes, penalty, and interest on the property granted tax relief under the provisions of this section. An obligation to pay recaptured taxes is extinguished by operation of force majeure. Force majeure means: fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms and other natural disasters, explosions, war, terrorist acts, riots, and the acts of superior governmental or military authority, and which the affected party is unable to prevent by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The term does not include any changes in\\n---\\ngeneral economic conditions such as inflation, interest rates, economic downturn or other factors of general application, bankruptcy or an event that merely makes performance more difficult, expensive or impractical.  \\n(l) A historic site for which an exemption has expired or has been withdrawn, revoked, or terminated may not requalify for a tax exemption under this section. Only one tax exemption at a time under this section may apply to a property.  \\n(m) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, a structure that has been designated as a landmark or as a contributing structure in a historic district pursuant to the Historic Preservation Ordinance and that is owned by the State of Texas or a political subdivision thereof is entitled to an exemption equal to 100 percent of the assessed value of the historic structure and the land necessary for access and use of such structure. If an application for an exemption pursuant to this subsection is granted prior to the adoption of the ad valorem tax rate for the tax year in which the application is granted, the exemption shall be effective as of January 1 of that tax year. If such an application is granted after the adoption of the ad valorem tax rate for the tax year in which the application is granted, the exemption shall be effective as of January 1 of the tax year following the date the application was granted. An exemption granted pursuant to this subsection shall remain effective until the property is sold.  \\n(Code 1968, § 44-4.1; Ord. No. 81-625, § 1, 4-1-81; Ord. No. 95-227, § 2, 3-1-95; Ord.
